# INFO430-SQL-Database

The SQL database for travel agencies and travelers is designed to handle a large amount of data and complex business rules. With over 1 million rows of data, this database is built to efficiently store and manage information related to travel itineraries, reservations, bookings, and customer data.

The database is optimized for fast data retrieval and processing, with indexes and data structures that enable quick access to relevant information. The database includes more than 50 stored procedures, which are pre-written SQL code that can be called by applications or other parts of the system to perform specific tasks. These stored procedures can improve performance, simplify code, and ensure consistency in data processing.

The database includes several business rules that enforce policies and regulations for travel agencies and travelers. These rules are implemented as triggers or constraints, which automatically check and enforce data integrity and consistency. For example, a rule might prevent a travel agency from booking a flight for a passenger who does not have a valid passport.

The database schema includes tables for travel itineraries, flights, hotels, rental cars, and other travel-related information. It also includes tables for customer data, such as personal information, loyalty program memberships, and travel preferences. The schema is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy integration with other systems and services.

Overall, the SQL database for travel agencies and travelers is a robust and reliable solution for managing large amounts of data and complex business rules. It is designed to provide fast, efficient, and secure access to travel-related information, while ensuring data integrity and compliance with regulations and policies.
